			<p>Since you're an admin, <span class="bold">you have access to special tools and settings</span> like User Management, Backups Management, Token Management, and more!</p>
			<p><span class="bold">These admin tools are located at the bottom of the kora side-menu.</span>  To get there, hit the (burgericon) icon in the top right corner of the Kora interface, and then look to the bottom of the new open side-menu.
